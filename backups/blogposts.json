  "desc": "Vim (/v…™m/;[5] a contraction of Vi IMproved) is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program. It is an improved clone of Bill Joy's vi. Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, derived Vim from a port of the Stevie editor for Amiga[6] and released a version to the public in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface.[7]\nSince its release for the Amiga, cross-platform development has made it available on many other systems. In 2006, it was voted the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal readers;[8] in 2015 the Stack Overflow developer survey found it to be the third most popular text editor,[9] and in 2019 the fifth most popular development environment.[10]",
