<br><h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2><p>Like most website operators, The Low End Studio collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The Low End Studio's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how The Low End Studio's visitors use its website. From time to time, The Low End Studio may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>The Low End Studio also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://thelowendstudio.com blog posts. The Low End Studio only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><br><h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Certain visitors to The Low End Studio's websites choose to interact with The Low End Studio in ways that require The Low End Studio to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that The Low End Studio gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at https://thelowendstudio.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><br><h2 id="Security">3.
